## SupaeroMoon Team aims for the European Rover Challenge
We are a student team of 30 students based at ISAE SUPAERO. SupaeroMoon aims to reduce the gap between students and lunar exploration.
Our long-term goal is to design, develop, build and test a lunar rover. Since the goal is ambitious, we start with the short-term goal of applying to the ERC2025.

Welcome to our repository!
